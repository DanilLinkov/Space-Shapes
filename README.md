# Space-Shapes

![GUI](/Images/GUI.png)

This project animates a variety of different shapes in a bounding box space.

Each shape has distinct properties for posistion, size, velocity and direction and the ability to have text

The shapes are:
- Image Rectangle Shape which is a rectangle shape displaying a given Image
- Carrier Shape which acts as a bounding box for shapes that can be added into it and bounce around inside
- Dynamic Shape which changes colour depending on what wall it hits
- Hexagon Shape, Rectangle Shape, Oval Shape are basic shapes

The GUI was made using swing and allows for addition, removal and information look up for the shapes.

In this project I learned to apply multiple design patterns, unit testing and multi-threading.
